    <p *ngIf="isOpen" class="text">The "TECHZONE Extended Warranty" insurance provides longer protection of the appliance you have
        purchased from TECHNOPOLIS. If the average manufacturer's warranty is 2 years, you can prudently extend its
        period to up to 5 years by using the extended warranty of TECHNOPOLIS. During the period, in which you are
        protected with the extended warranty of TECHZONE, the insurer "Allianz Bulgaria" Insurance Company will pay
        for all approved repairs, including for any labour costs and costs for spare parts. You will have a hotline at
        your disposal â€“ 0700 1 10 30 to communicate any fault to the administrator "Brand Affinity Management Services"
        EOOD.</p>
